The app is a memory card game in which the objective is to find all pairs of country flag and country name.

On the main page there are game rules and a user can choose number of cards (difficulty of the game) and custom card back. Also the user can navigate to page with best results. TOP-5 results for each level and player profile are stored in localStorage.

By clicking on a card – it turns over smoothly, matching cards disappear just as smoothly, if a pair does not match – both cards are turned face down.
The distribution of cards is always random (there are 50 different countries in total). At the end of the game shows modal window with congratulations to the player ad TOP-5 results for selected level.

There is a custom 404 page, where user will be redirected in case of invalid URL.
